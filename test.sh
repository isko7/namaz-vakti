To automatically start a Python script after a Raspberry Pi connects to a WiFi network, you can use a combination of systemd services and a simple bash script. Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Create the Python Script:

    Save your Python script, let's say myscript.py, in a location of your choice.

    python

# myscript.py
print("Hello, Raspberry Pi!")
# Your script logic goes here

Create a Bash Script:

Create a bash script, for example, start_myscript.sh. This script will wait until the Raspberry Pi is connected to the WiFi network and then execute your Python script.

bash

# start_myscript.sh
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    if nc -zw1 google.com 443; then
        echo "Connected to the internet. Starting myscript.py"
        python3 /path/to/myscript.py
        break
    else
        echo "Waiting for internet connection..."
        sleep 5
    fi
done

Make sure to replace /path/to/myscript.py with the actual path to your Python script.

Create a Systemd Service:

Create a systemd service file, for example, myscript.service.

ini

# myscript.service
[Unit]
Description=Run myscript after WiFi connection

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash /path/to/start_myscript.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Replace /path/to/start_myscript.sh with the actual path to your bash script.

Copy Files to Systemd Directory:

Copy both start_myscript.sh and myscript.service to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

bash

sudo cp start_myscript.sh /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp myscript.service /etc/systemd/system/

Enable and Start the Service:

bash

    sudo systemctl enable myscript.service
    sudo systemctl start myscript.service

    This will enable and start the service. Now, whenever your Raspberry Pi connects to the WiFi network, the script will wait for an internet connection and then execute your Python script.

Please adapt the paths and file names according to your actual file locations. Also, ensure that the necessary permissions are set for executing the scripts.
